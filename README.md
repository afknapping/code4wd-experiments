## setup

- clone
- `bundle` to install
- `bundle exec jekyll serve` to start
- open `http://127.0.0.1:4000/code4wd-experiments/` in a browser

### [browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/)?

- `npm install` to install browser-sync
- `foreman start` boots both jekyll and [a browsersync setup](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/issues/4644#issuecomment-228517258).

it opens the correct port but **you have manually add the `baseurl` (`/code4wd-experiments/`)**


## Content Model

    speakers/speaker-name.md
    bucket/speaker-name.jpg
    talks/talk-title.md
    bucket/talk-title.jpg

this might help with filenames: **[Slugify the-online-slug-generator](https://blog.tersmitten.nl/slugify/)**

## Content details

### `talks`

add talks by adding a file to the `_talks` folder

    _talks
       |- my-awesome-talk.md
       |- more-awesome-talking.md
       |- 4-33.md

See any existing file in `_talks` to look up the structure.

See `_includes/talks.html` for variables in use.

- filename is a slugified version of the talk title as generated by liquid's `{{ talk.title | slugify }}` in order to generate files for `{% include %}`
- `site.talks[n].speaker` should match one of `site.speakers[n].name` â€“ the talk will then be rendered to the respective speaker profile.
- markup is not rendered for empty variables. if, for example, a video is not yet available on youtube (or wont ever be, because the talk was never recorded), you can leave the `youtube_id` field empty and the respective markup for the video embed will not be rendered.
- body can have markdown

### `speakers`

add speakers by adding a file to the `_speakers` folder

    _speakers
       |- mary-pineda.md
       |- nancy-t-rogers.md
       |- marsha-vega.md

See any existing file in `_speakers` to look up the structure.

See `_includes/speakers.html` for variables in use.

- filename is a slugified version of the talk title as generated by liquid's `{{ speaker.name | slugify }}` in order to generate files for `{% include %}`
