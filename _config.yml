# this is just to ovverride the default content of exclude
# see https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/
exclude:
- none

# this does not work
# if the order on https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/ is relevant,
# exclude is read after include. that way i can include node_modules
# all day long â€“ exclude does still filter it out because excluding is
# happening after including
# this is logical though not intuitive
# include: ['node_modules']
